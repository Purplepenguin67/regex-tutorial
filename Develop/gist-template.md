# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial is going to explain the use of regex to match emails using the expression /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This is useful when validating emails using web applications and technologies.

## Summary

Regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. This tutorial will go over the components of a regex and how it applies to matching an email.
